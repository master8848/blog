## Abstract

The traditional education system which is prevalent worldwide, is increasingly failing to meet the needs of ever growing and demanding society. This paper proposes a revolutionary education model that incorporates economic considerations, flexible learning paths, and lifelong educational opportunities. By allowing individuals to pursue education at their own pace and on their own terms, this model aims to address the limitations of the current education system. Key components include the integration of multiple technologies, the combination of educational levels, subject-specific certifications, and open-book examinations. This system not only serve to the diverse interests and circumstances of learners but also enhances the relevance and applicability of education in the modern world.

## Introduction

The 21st-century education system has encountered significant challenges, including the rigidity of curriculum, the inability to adapt to individual learning needs, and the economic and opportunity cost on students. These issues are prevalent across various countries and educational levels. This paper explores a novel education model that reworks the traditional system with an emphasis on economic viability, flexibility, and inclusivity.

## The Proposed Education Model

### Key Features

1. **Flexible Learning Paths**: The proposed model allows students to pursue education at their own pace, combining self-study with optional institutional guidance. This approach is particularly beneficial for adults seeking to further their education or shift careers. Or students from extraordinary circumstances.

2. **Subject-Specific Certifications**: Instead of a one-size-fits-all degree, students can earn certifications for individual subjects with different levels. This modular approach enables continuous learning and specialization. And easy access to multi disciplinary learning.

3. **Integrated Educational Levels**: The model combines school, high school, college, and university education. It retains mandatory subjects for younger students while allowing self-paced, subject-specific study for older students.

4. **Economic Considerations**: By decoupling education from mandatory attendance, the model reduces costs. Exams can be administered by certified institutions, increasing accessibility and affordability. Also by increasing number of people involved there is win win situation for institution as their revenue can grow. As more people might get interested in continuing to pursue study on other discipline.

5. **Open-Book Examinations**: To promote deep understanding and analytical skills, the model emphasizes open-book exams, which assess student's ability to synthesize and apply knowledge rather than memorize facts.

6. **Graduation, Diploma and other courses:** To promote interaction between subject this degrees have been integral which can be implemented under more broad term as program which is separate evaluation from subject and focus on important knowledge expected out of program and relevant subject/topic interaction.

### Benefits

1. **Adaptability for Dropouts and Career Changers**: This system accommodates individuals who have left the traditional education path and wish to return later, or people finding themself in career where they are required other subject knowledge, offering them flexible options to gain certifications relevant to their new interests or careers.

2. **Support for High-Intelligence Individuals**: By providing challenging and self-paced learning opportunities, the model keeps highly intelligent students engaged and prevents boredom and disengagement.

3. **Early Skill Acquisition**: Young learners can acquire industry-relevant skills earlier, enabling them to contribute effectively to the workforce and society. On current system a person is only able to contribute after around 22 yr of age while for some individual this does seem large time to acquire multiple skill which is also limited by current system but that must not be the case. They can have flexibility to choose to get sharp in different subject or they want to start contributing to society at earlier age.

## Economic Implications

### Cost Efficiency

- **Reduced Infrastructure Costs**: With more self-study options and fewer mandatory classes, educational institutions can lower infrastructure costs.
- **Increased Exam Revenue**: Certified institutions can generate revenue by administering exams, making the system economically sustainable.

### Accessibility

- **Lower Tuition Fees**: The flexible model can reduces the financial burden on students, making education more accessible to a broader population.
- **Mentoring and Guidance Services**: Institutions can offer additional services, such as mentoring and guidance, creating new revenue streams while supporting student's educational journeys.

## Open-Book Examinations

### Rationale

Open-book exams align with the modern educational goal of fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. They encourage students to understand and apply concepts rather than merely memorize information.

### Implementation

- **Subject-Specific Exams**: Each subject has its open-book exam, tailored to test comprehension and application of the material.
- **Program-Level Exams**: For program graduation, exams encompass multiple subjects, evaluating the interaction and integration of knowledge across different areas.

## Conclusion

The proposed education model addresses the shortcomings of the traditional system by incorporating flexibility, economic considerations, and lifelong learning opportunities. It is designed to be adaptable, inclusive, and relevant to the needs of today's learners. By implementing subject-specific certifications, open-book examinations, and integrated educational levels, the model promises to revolutionize education in the 21st century, making it more accessible, engaging, and effective.
